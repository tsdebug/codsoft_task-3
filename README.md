## 💡 The Logic Challenge
This project serves as the final milestone (Task 3) of my **CodSoft Virtual Internship**. 

After mastering structure and design in my previous tasks, this project was dedicated to **Algorithmic Logic**. The goal was to build a fully functional calculator that doesn't just look good, but *thinks* correctly—handling user inputs, processing arithmetic operations, and returning accurate results in real-time.

## ⚡ Features
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division flawlessly.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean, grid-based layout that keeps buttons accessible and easy to read.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Buttons respond visually to clicks, providing a tactile feel to the web application.
- **Error Handling:** Handles basic calculation edge cases smoothly.

## 🧠 Technical Learnings
Transitioning from static pages to a dynamic application taught me the fundamentals of programming logic:
1.  **DOM Manipulation:** I learned how to "listen" to button clicks in HTML and trigger specific functions in JavaScript.
2.  **String Parsing & Evaluation:** Understanding how to take a string of text (e.g., "5+5") and process it as a mathematical equation.
3.  **UI/UX Grid Systems:** I used CSS Grid/Flexbox to ensure the keys were perfectly aligned, mimicking the familiarity of a physical calculator.
4.  **State Management:** Tracking the current input versus the stored result.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Structure of the display screen and keypads.
- **CSS3:** Styling the "look and feel," focusing on color contrast and button layout.
- **JavaScript:** The brain behind the calculator (handling the math logic).

## 🏃🏻‍♀️ How to Run Locally
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tsdebug/codsoft_task-3.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
